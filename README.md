# ENIAC_WBS - Eniac's Expansion to Brazil Market Analysis

Overview

This project explores the potential expansion of Eniac, an fictional European e-commerce company specializing in Apple-compatible tech accessories, into the Brazilian market. Brazil's e-commerce sector, represents an opportunity for growth. However, Eniac faces challenges due to its lack of connections with local providers, delivery services, and customer support agencies.
Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company, offers a centralized order management system and logistics support tailored to small and medium-sized enterprises. Eniac is considering partnering with Magist for a 3-year contract as an intermediary solution while building its supply chain.
The goal of this project is to analyze Magist's database to address these concerns and provide actionable recommendations to Eniac's CEO. The analysis will focus on assessing Magist's ability to handle high-end tech products and its delivery performance to ensure customer satisfaction.

Key Concerns

Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?
